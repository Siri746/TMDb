# TMDb API Node.js Project

This project includes three scripts that interact with the TMDb API to fetch movie-related data.

### Scripts:

1. **search_movie.js**: Searches for movies by name.
2. **discover_movie.js**: Discovers movies based on filters like genre.
3. **find_by_id.js**: Fetches detailed information about a movie by its ID.

### Requirements:
- Node.js
- Needle module (`npm install needle`)

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install needle`
3. Run a script: `node search_movie.js`

Replace `YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY` with your TMDb API key.
